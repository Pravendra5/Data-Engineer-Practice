-- we will solve a question that involves working with a table named job_listings, which contains job postings from various companies on LinkedIn. 
-- The objective is to write a SQL query that identifies and counts the number of companies that have posted duplicate job listings.

-- ( Note: Duplicate job Listings are those job postings that are from the same company (company_id) that have identical title and description. ) 

use practice;

CREATE TABLE job_listings (
    company_id INT,
    job_id INT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT
);

INSERT INTO job_listings (company_id, job_id, title, description) VALUES
(827, 248, 'Business Analyst', 'Business analyst evaluates past and current business data with the primary goal of improving decision-making processes within organisations.'),
(845, 149, 'Business Analyst', 'Business analyst evaluates past and current business data with the primary goal of improving decision-making processes within organisations.'),
